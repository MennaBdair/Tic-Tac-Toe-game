# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
first the player 1 is X and the player 2 is O so when the play start the player 1 choose number between 1 to 9 then enter 
and player 2 do same after each turn the statues for playing show in the play if you choose number out of range dont worry 
you can enter again another number.
when you if any players is win the game end and tell you whos win, if all places full of X and O without winner the play tell you 
after that the game end then the play chooser you if you want to play another time or not just inside yes or no in any type 
and the play reppeted.
Good luck.
